Hello,

My name is Rafał Ileczko. With my technical expertise, product-oriented mindset and leadership experience, I am confident in my ability to contribute to your team and drive business value through development.

Throughout my career, I have consistently focused on the business value of my work, rather than pursuing tech perfection. As a product-oriented engineer I always do my best to understand business and user needs before writing any line of code.

At my current job. I am in the position of Senior Full-stack Developer, where I am responsible for development and maintenance of frontend React web application and many backend services. I propose and implement new features, develop new internal design system and components library. Significant part of my work includes also collaborating with the product team planning new features.

In my previous role I have led successful React and React Native projects, using ClojureScript and Typescript, and supervised a team of three frontend developers. My contribution, besides typical tasks, included improving the process of cooperation between product, design, frontend and backend teams which resulted in better time-to-release of implemented features, and made the whole work pipeline more stable - we could plan more accurately. By identifying pain points and inefficiencies, I introduced solutions that improved overall productivity and quality of our deliverables. I started the process of rewriting the codebase and many other projects whose goal was to either improve developer experience or reduce possibility of introducing new issues.

I am excited about the opportunity to join your company and contribute to your ongoing success. My passion for frontend development, combined with my product mindset and leadership experience, make me a strong candidate for this position. I am confident that my skills and qualifications align well with the requirements outlined in the job description.

Thank you for considering my application. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my contributions can help drive your company forward. I look forward to the possibility of further discussing my candidacy with you.

Sincerely,\n
Rafał Ileczko
